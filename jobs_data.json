Cats are carnivores – they need meat to thrive – but cat food companies use powdered animal derivatives because it’s cheaper and easier, and they top it up with grains and fillers that cats find hard to digest. It’s all about shelf life and profit; not what cats really need.\n\nWe do things differently at KatKin. We’re changing the cat food industry, with our 100% Fresh-cooked premium meat recipes, delivered to doorsteps everywhere. Each recipe is designed by our in-house vets and nutritionists, to be the very best (and tastiest) nutrition for cats.\n\nKatKin is building a global challenger brand in cat health and wellbeing, going after a $50B global market. Beyond the core product of Fresh food for cats, KatKin’s vision is to build a set of products and services for Cat Parents to manage their cat’s health. Everything from litter and treats, to digital health management for your cat.\n\nToday, KatKin is a UK D2C business that recently expanded into Retail and is planning to launch in the EU this year.\n\nWhy You’ll Love Working With Us\n\nWe’re not some faceless corp. We’re one of London’s fastest-growing scaleups - a mission-driven rocket ship, vertically integrated from Digital, Marketing, Brand and R&D to manufacturing (our factory is in Suffolk) and CX, with incredibly talented people from businesses like Amazon, Gousto, Harry’s, Sky, Deliveroo, ASOS, Wise and tails.com.\n\nWe’re deeply committed to career growth for our engineers. With a clear, structured internal career framework and biannual performance reviews, we ensure everyone knows what’s expected at each level and how to progress.

We do this in some of the most advanced and important industries of our time – including Space, Aerospace, Medical Devices, Additive Manufacturing, Electric Vehicles, Motorsport, and Renewables. Our work creates positive impact for society, be it by improving the design of artificial hearts, reducing CO2 emissions from aircraft and road vehicles, and increasing the performance of wind turbines.\n\nThe Role\n\nYour role, first and foremost, is to help our customers solve their most important problems. As a Software Engineer, this takes the form of building and deploying applications which utilise the power of our Physics AI models to enable our customers to build better, faster, and cheaper.\n\nAs a member of the delivery team, you’ll work directly with customers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to develop applications that change the way advanced engineering gets done. We’re looking for someone who can grasp advanced engineering concepts across multiple industries, fundamentally understand the problems that engineers face, and build tools to eliminate these problems.\n\nWho We're Looking For\n\nTechnical ability: We work across a wide range of engineering disciplines, all of which are high complexity. Someone with a track record of solving hard problems is a must, a background in Mechanical Engineering or similar is a plus. This role deals with breadth across the full stack, having a solid foundation in software engineering, API design and deploying applications to production is desired.\n\nProactivity & high ownership: You’ll be responsible for driving impact for our customers, whatever that might look like. We're looking for someone who is a go-getter and is naturally inclined to find problems and solve them end to end. You own the responsibility to get things done, and will pick up the skills and experience needed to solve novel problems quickly.\n\nSolution-focussed: We build tools that customers need, not just the ones they want. Someone who is customer obsessed, and can work alongside our customers to understand their problems and build applications which change the way they do engineering.\n\nWhat a day might look like\n\nCollaborate with cross-functional teams: Collaborate with data scientists and machine learning engineers to ship physics models to our customers in a way that delivers maximum value. Work with designers and front-end engineers to shape the UX in line with customer needs.\n\nE2E application design: Work with customers to shape tools which are impactful for their teams. Construct low-lift prototypes of your ideas and ship them directly to the customer. Rapidly iterate on this experience through constant user feedback.\n\nBackend Development: Build and maintain RESTful APIs (FastAPI) and micro services in Python to serve Large Physics Models to the end users. Working with other software engineers in our platform team, deploy these applications to the cloud so they become key tools in our customer’s day-to-day workflow. We use a mixture of Helm, Kubernetes, Terraform and AWS/Azure for provisioning and running our infrastructure.\n\nPhysicsX Development: Distill down complex solutions built across multiple use cases into fundamental components. Pitch and execute the development of features on top of our core platform offering. Drive the direction of PhysicsX to be better positioned to solve ever harder problems with our customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe value diversity and are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of sex, race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, disability, age, sexual orientation or gender identity. We strongly encourage individuals from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech to apply.

Cats are carnivores – they need meat to thrive – but cat food companies use powdered animal derivatives because it’s cheaper and easier, and they top it up with grains and fillers that cats find hard to digest. It’s all about shelf life and profit; not what cats really need.\n\nWe do things differently at KatKin. We’re changing the cat food industry, with our 100% Fresh-cooked premium meat recipes, delivered to doorsteps everywhere. Each recipe is designed by our in-house vets and nutritionists, to be the very best (and tastiest) nutrition for cats.\n\nKatKin is building a global challenger brand in cat health and wellbeing, going after a $50B global market. Beyond the core product of Fresh food for cats, KatKin’s vision is to build a set of products and services for Cat Parents to manage their cat’s health. Everything from litter and treats, to digital health management for your cat.\n\nToday, KatKin is a UK D2C business that recently expanded into Retail and is planning to launch in the EU this year.\n\nWhy You’ll Love Working With Us\n\nWe’re not some faceless corp. We’re one of London’s fastest-growing scaleups - a mission-driven rocket ship, vertically integrated from Digital, Marketing, Brand and R&D to manufacturing (our factory is in Suffolk) and CX, with incredibly talented people from businesses like Amazon, Gousto, Harry’s, Sky, Deliveroo, ASOS, Wise and tails.com.\n\nWe’re deeply committed to career growth for our engineers. With a clear, structured internal career framework and biannual performance reviews, we ensure everyone knows what’s expected at each level and how to progress. Whether you’re just starting out or aiming for a management role, you’ll get regular, actionable feedback and support to help you grow in the direction you choose.\n\nThe Role\n\nMillions of cat parents engage with KatKin every month, and as a Junior Frontend Engineer at KatKin, you’ll work alongside our Engineering team in bringing our hardcore cat parent’s digital journey to life. Think millions of happier cats and glowing Trustpilot reviews (4.6/5 and going up!).\n\nYou will work closely with our Director of Engineering, Product, Design, Data, and the rest of the Engineering team to help meet the day-to-day and long-term ambitions of KatKin and its customers. You will own and create the components and technology necessary to provide a best-in-class experience for cat parents whenever they visit our website or use our subscription service.\n\nWe are a close-knit, focused team who are committed to consistently delivering high quality technology, on time, as part of a tech-driven mindset that lets us focus on building the right solutions for scaling our business into the future.\n\nOur current tech stack makes heavy use of TypeScript, particularly NextJS on the frontend, NestJS microservices on the backend with Prisma, and various other technologies and tools like Postgresql and RabbitMQ.\n\nThis role will work from our London office in Farringdon 3 days a week (no set days though). This is not negotiable.\n\nNote: AI-generated answers to our application questions about what attracted you to us and the role will be auto-rejected. We want your reasons.\n\nKey ownership areas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNice to haves\n\n\n\nWhat We Offer\n\n\n\nApply for this job\n\n\n\nWe aim to encourage a culture where people can be themselves and be valued for their strengths.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.\n\nWe realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to build things at Cloudflare but are unsure about which team to apply for, this role will give you the best opportunity to match with a team that is most aligned to your experience, skill, and ambition. We've created a hiring process designed to find great candidates and figure out where they fit best as we go along. At the end of the hiring process you will have the opportunity to meet with one or more teams to find out if there is a fit, but if you discover during the interview process that a particular team or product area is interesting to you let us know.\n\n\n\nCloudflare’s Engineers build and operate the software that helps power 25+ million Internet properties and millions of businesses around the world. Across our engineering organizations, we have opportunities for high caliber, curious and empathetic people to take on big challenges and build some of the best skills in the industry. We’re looking for talented team members to help build high-growth products, help scale our expanding network, build tools to improve availability, performance, uptime, and response times, and make systems failure-resistant and ready-to-scale.\n\nCloudflare is a system spanning the globe, on a mission to make the Internet better, safer, and more powerful every day. As a Software Engineer at Cloudflare, you’ll work on the code that runs close to the end user, runs at a massive scale, and is deployed to 330+ cities around the world.\n\n\n\nSince we don't know what team you'll be working on quite yet, here's some things that we do at Cloudflare. This is not a complete list, but gives a good indica\n\ntion of the wide variety of things you might work on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think some of this list describes you (or what you aspire to be) we would love to talk to you. While not listed as a requirement, we also want to call out that most roles need the flexibility to be on-call outside of standard working hours to address technical issues as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome team-specific things we think are interesting and want to highlight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\n\n: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.\n\n: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.\n\n: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\n\nSound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!\n\nThis position may require access to information protected under U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.
